    Good job at chooseing the fun option. I mean I was hoping that you would pick this option but didnt want to say it
    out loud.

  <p> Anyway man do you want to actually contiue on this path or would you like to just stay where we are right now and
    look around. I will say that one option might kill you... we will see how it goes. Maybe you will live to make
    another dicision.
