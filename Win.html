  <p>
    I guess I can tell you now. IT WAS A GAME. This whole time you were just in a game trying not to die. If you did
    welllll I dont really know what to say then, good job the second time.
  </p>
  <p> Since you did so well and are now done with it all you can redo it if you want and see if you are still as good as
    before.
