    Now on to your first decision of this mission. What web do you think is causing the problems. Sources say that it is
    a regular website somewhere doing the hacking but it could also be that pesky dark web that everyone talks about.
    Although I wouldnt subjest going there it might be a good place to start.

    Anyway do not let anything I say get in you way. Do what you think is right. (although my ideas are usualy right)
    but that is just my opinion.
