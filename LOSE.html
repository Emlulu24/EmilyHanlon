    I guess I can tell you now. IT WAS A GAME. This whole time you were just in a game trying not to die. If you did
    welllll I dont really know what to say then your in the wrong place. This is for those of you who had gotten to the
    end of a route and failed miserably.

  <p> Since you did so poorly and are now done with it all you can redo it if you want and see if you are still as good
    as before.
