    Good job failing man. I mean I expexted it at the begining but I still though I should tell you ya suck at surviving
    the game. I gave you clear instructions DONT DIE! Come on it is pretty easy. Even I could do it!

    at least. I mean chickening out is stupid dude. At least try next time.</p>
